## Introduction

The **Condensed Table Feature** provides a simplified, mobile-friendly view of volleyball league standings that focuses on the most essential information. Instead of displaying all 19 columns of detailed statistics, the condensed view shows only 6 key columns:

- **Position** - Team's current ranking
- **Team** - Team name with logo
- **Games Played** - Total matches played
- **Wins** - Number of matches won
- **Losses** - Number of matches lost
- **Ranking Points** - Current points total

### Benefits

- **Improved Mobile Experience**: Cleaner display on small screens with card-based layout
- **Faster Loading**: Reduced data processing and smaller HTML output
- **Better Readability**: Focus on essential statistics without overwhelming detail
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing shortcodes continue to work unchanged
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

To display a condensed table, simply add `view="condensed"` to your existing volleyball table shortcode:

```php
[volleyball_table league="Men's Premier Division" view="condensed"]
```

### Default Behavior

Without the `view` parameter, tables display in full mode (all 19 columns):

```php
[volleyball_table league="Men's Premier Division"]
```

### Nested Leagues

The condensed view works with nested leagues and accordion displays:

```php
[volleyball_table league="Men's Division 2" view="condensed"]
```

## Visual Comparison

### Full Table View (19 Columns)
```
| Pos | Team | Points | Matches | Sets | Points | Results | Ratios | Penalty |
|     |      |        | P W L   | W L R| W L R  | 3-0 3-1...| S P   |         |
```
- **Columns**: Position, Team, Points, Played, Won, Lost, Sets Won, Sets Lost, Set Ratio, Points Won, Points Lost, Point Ratio, 3-0 Wins, 3-1 Wins, 3-2 Wins, 2-3 Losses, 1-3 Losses, 0-3 Losses, Set Ratio, Point Ratio, Penalty
- **Best For**: Detailed statistical analysis, desktop viewing
- **Mobile**: Horizontal scrolling required

### Condensed Table View (6 Columns)
```
| Pos | Team | Games Played | Wins | Losses | Ranking Points |
```
- **Columns**: Position, Team (with logo), Games Played, Wins, Losses, Ranking Points
- **Best For**: Quick overviews, mobile viewing, embedded displays
- **Mobile**: Card-based layout, no scrolling needed

### Mobile Responsive Behavior

#### Desktop (>768px width)
- Standard table layout
- All columns visible
- Team logos: 20px × 20px

#### Mobile (≤768px width)
- **Full Table**: Horizontal scroll required
- **Condensed Table**: Card-based layout
  - Each team becomes an individual card
  - Data labels shown for each field
  - Team logos: 16px × 16px
  - No horizontal scrolling

---

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### PHP Classes Modified
- **`includes/class-volleyball-shortcode.php`**
  - Added `view` parameter validation at line 41
  - Created `render_condensed_table()` method at line 475
  - Updated shortcode logic to route to appropriate renderer

#### New Methods
```php
private function render_condensed_table($teams)
```
- Generates 6-column HTML table
- Preserves team logos and styling
- Uses `volleyball-table-condensed` CSS class

#### Parameter Validation
```php
if (!in_array($view, array('full', 'condensed'))) {
    $view = 'full';
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### JavaScript Updates (`volleyball-ajax.js`)
- **`generateCondensedTableHtml()`** function at line 375
- AJAX URL construction includes view parameter
- Dynamic table generation for both full and condensed views

#### CSS Styling (`volleyball-styles.css`)
- **`.volleyball-table-condensed`** class starting at line 266
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile cards
- Team logo sizing (20px desktop, 16px mobile)
- Color scheme: Blue headers (#007cba), Golden points (#d4a853)

### Data Processing

#### JSON Field Handling
The condensed view extracts data from the same JSON fields as the full view:
- **Games Played**: `match_stats['played']`
- **Wins**: `match_stats['won']`
- **Losses**: `match_stats['lost']`
- **Ranking Points**: `team->ranking_points`

#### Safe Data Extraction
Uses the existing `safe_json_decode()` utility method to handle:
- String JSON data
- Already-decoded array data
- Malformed or missing data (defaults to 0)

### AJAX Integration

#### REST API Endpoints
- Existing endpoints support the new `view` parameter
- URL format: `/wp-json/volleyball/v1/teams/League?view=condensed`
- Response includes view parameter for client-side processing

#### Dynamic Loading
- Accordion interfaces pass view parameter to AJAX requests
- JavaScript generates appropriate table HTML based on view type
- Loading states and error handling preserved

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Table Still Shows Full View
**Problem**: Shortcode shows 19 columns instead of 6
**Solutions**:
- Check parameter spelling: `view="condensed"` (case-sensitive)
- Verify no extra spaces: `view="condensed"` not `view=" condensed "`
- Clear any caching plugins

#### 2. Mobile Layout Not Working
**Problem**: Condensed table doesn't show cards on mobile
**Solutions**:
- Ensure CSS file is loaded: `volleyball-styles.css`
- Check viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- Test browser width is actually ≤768px

#### 3. AJAX Loading Issues
**Problem**: Accordion doesn't load condensed view
**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify REST API endpoints are accessible
- Ensure `volleyball-ajax.js` is loaded

#### 4. Missing Team Logos
**Problem**: Team logos don't appear in condensed view
**Solutions**:
- Verify logo URLs are valid in source data
- Check image permissions and accessibility
- Confirm CSS for `.team-logo` class is applied

#### 5. Data Not Displaying
**Problem**: Shows "No data for league" message
**Solutions**:
- Verify league name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check data import has completed successfully
- Confirm database contains recent data

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Shortcode Syntax**
   ```php
   [volleyball_table league="Exact League Name" view="condensed"]
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Verify AJAX requests are successful
   - Check network tab for failed requests

3. **Test with Full View**
   ```php
   [volleyball_table league="Same League Name" view="full"]
   ```
   If full view works but condensed doesn't, it's a view-specific issue.

4. **Validate Data Source**
   - Check if league exists in database
   - Verify recent import date
   - Test with different league names

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

#### No Action Required
Existing shortcodes will continue to work exactly as before:
```php
[volleyball_table league="Men's Premier Division"]
```
This will still display the full 19-column table.

#### Adopting Condensed View
To use the new condensed view, simply add the view parameter:
```php
[volleyball_table league="Men's Premier Division" view="condensed"]
```

#### Gradual Migration Strategy
1. **Test First**: Try condensed view on a few tables
2. **Mobile Focus**: Use condensed view for mobile-heavy pages
3. **Mixed Approach**: Use full view for analysis, condensed for overviews
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback before wide deployment

### For Developers

#### CSS Customization
The condensed table uses the `.volleyball-table-condensed` class:
```css
.volleyball-table-condensed {
    /* Your custom styles */
}
```

#### JavaScript Extensions
Hook into the table generation:
```javascript
// After table is generated
$(document).on('volleyball-table-loaded', function(event, tableType) {
    if (tableType === 'condensed') {
        // Your custom logic
    }
});
```

#### PHP Hooks
Filter the condensed table output:
```php
add_filter('volleyball_condensed_table_html', function($html, $teams) {
    // Modify HTML before output
    return $html;
}, 10, 2);
```
