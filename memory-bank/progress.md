# Progress: Volleyball League Import Plugin

## What Works
- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Plugin broken into separate modular classes with single responsibilities:
  - `VolleyballImport` (main): Plugin initialization, database table creation, WordPress hook management
  - `VolleyballAdmin` (includes/class-volleyball-admin.php): Admin settings page with hardcoded shortcode display and GitHub configuration
  - `VolleyballShortcode` (includes/class-volleyball-shortcode.php): Shortcode handlers for tables and trends with immediate sub-league loading
  - `VolleyballAjax` (includes/class-volleyball-ajax.php): REST API endpoints and AJAX handlers for data import/retrieval
  - `VolleyballUtils` (includes/class-volleyball-utils.php): Utility functions and frontend script/style enqueuing
  - `VolleyballLeagues` (includes/class-volleyball-leagues.php): League definitions and sub-league logic
- **Plugin Foundation**: Proper WordPress initialization with deferred loading, creates custom DB table (wp_volleyball_teams) on activation with all required fields including subleague for nested leagues
- **Admin Interface**: Complete settings page with hardcoded shortcode options (8 leagues) displayed in responsive grid with copy-to-clipboard functionality, GitHub configuration, and user-configurable primary/secondary colors
- **REST API**: POST /volleyball/v1/import-teams fetches from GitHub, parses nested JSON including subLeague field, validates, sanitizes, upserts to DB (idempotent for daily imports), returns results. GET /volleyball/v1/teams/{league}/{subleague} retrieves teams with decoded JSON stats
- **Shortcodes**: [volleyball_table league="x"] renders styled tables with immediate first sub-league display for nested leagues; detects nested leagues (Div 2/3 men/women) and renders accordion with sub-league sections; [volleyball_trends league="x"] renders Chart.js trends
- **Sub-League Auto-Loading**: Nested leagues (Men's Div 2/3, Women's Div 2/3) automatically display the first sub-league table immediately on page load, with JavaScript handling dynamic switching between sub-leagues
- **Styling**: Responsive CSS with Bootstrap integration and CSS variables for customizable colors; intelligent enqueuing only when shortcodes are used, with fallback mechanisms for page builders like Bricks
- **Data Handling**: Comprehensive sanitization (sanitize_text_field, esc_url_raw, wp_json_encode), permission checks (edit_posts for import, public for GET), subleague parsing from nested JSON structures
- **Error Handling**: Robust initialization with WordPress function availability checks, fallback enqueuing methods, and graceful degradation

## What's Left to Build
- **Import Trigger**: Support manual POST trigger; add optional WP cron for automated weekly fetches
- **Trends Logic**: Aggregate historical data (e.g., position over dates) for Chart.js line charts; handle multiple leagues/files and subleagues
- **Testing & Polish**: Comprehensive testing across all league types; enhanced error handling for fetch failures, improved logging

## Current Status
- **COMPLETED**: Full modular architecture refactor with working auto-loading first sub-league functionality
- Plugin successfully loads without errors after modularization
- All existing functionality preserved with improved code organization
- Admin interface displays all 8 shortcode options with copy buttons
- First sub-league tables load immediately for nested leagues (e.g., Men's Division 2 shows D2M-A by default)

## Known Issues
- Historical data import: Decide if auto-fetch archives during import or on-demand for trends shortcode
- Chart.js Integration: Ensure CDN enqueue only when needed; handle no-data cases gracefully
- Rate Limits: GitHub API calls may need caching with WP transients

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial: Monolithic 1,426-line single file with manual shortcode management
- Phase 1: Modular architecture with separated concerns and proper class structure
- Phase 2: Hardcoded shortcode options to prevent copy-paste errors, immediate sub-league loading
- Current: Clean, maintainable, modular plugin with immediate user feedback and proper WordPress integration
- Future: Enhanced historical data handling, admin UI improvements, export features
