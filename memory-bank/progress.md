# Progress: Volleyball League Import Plugin

## What Works
- **Plugin Foundation**: Class-based structure in volleyball-import.php initializes correctly, creates custom DB table (wp_volleyball_teams) on activation with all required fields (team_id, team_name, league, position, etc.).
- **REST API**: POST /volleyball/v1/import-teams handles direct JSON input, validates, sanitizes, upserts to DB (idempotent for daily imports), returns results. GET /volleyball/v1/teams/{league} retrieves latest teams with decoded JSON stats for display.
- **Data Handling**: Sanitization (sanitize_text_field, esc_url_raw, wp_json_encode), permission checks (edit_posts for import, public for GET).
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized with core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md) providing full context.

## What's Left to Build
- **GitHub Integration**: Modify import_teams to fetch JSON files from GitHub repo (/current/{league}.json for latest, optionally /historical for trends) using wp_remote_get with auth token from WP options.
- **Configuration**: Add admin settings page to input GitHub repo details (owner, repo, branch, token) and store in options.
- **Shortcodes**: Implement [volleyball_table league="x"] to query DB and render HTML table; [volleyball_trends league="x"] to query historical, generate Chart.js config, enqueue script/style, render canvas.
- **Import Trigger**: Support manual POST trigger; add optional WP cron for automated weekly fetches.
- **Trends Logic**: Aggregate historical data (e.g., position over dates) for Chart.js line charts; handle multiple leagues/files.
- **Testing & Polish**: Error handling for fetch failures, logging, responsive CSS, documentation updates.

## Current Status
- Planning phase: Memory Bank complete, architecture documented. Awaiting repo details for precise implementation.
- No active issues in existing code; plugin loads without errors.
- Development environment: Local WP site ready for testing.

## Known Issues
- Missing GitHub specifics: Exact repo path, auth setup, JSON key mapping (confirm teamId vs team_id, etc.).
- Historical data import: Decide if auto-fetch archives during import or on-demand for trends shortcode.
- Chart.js Integration: Ensure CDN enqueue only when needed; handle no-data cases gracefully.
- Rate Limits: GitHub API calls may need caching with WP transients.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial: Direct n8n to WP DB logging (non-portable).
- Current: n8n → GitHub JSON files → WP plugin fetch/insert → DB → shortcodes/display (portable, adds trends).
- Future: Potential admin UI for leagues, export features, multi-repo support.
